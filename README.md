# ClickerGameRuby

Software Engineering class - Attempted to learn a whole new language in a given time to complete a project. The project was in-class time only, cannot be worked out outside of the class. The project is a simple clicker game, just like a cookie clicker. Very minimal features are included due to the project time running behind the schedule of our regular class time. This was worked within the AWS platform. The codes are available through the downloadable ZIP file.
